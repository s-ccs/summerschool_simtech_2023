# Task
1. Create a new package `MyStatsPackage` using `generate`
2. Add your `statistic.jl` & "include" it. 
3. Export all functions
4. Create a new environment in a separate folder and add the package.
5. Does `using MyStatsPackage` work now? :tada: congratulations!
6. Go back to your package environment. Now add a dependency (e.g. ProgressMeter) and a `compat`-entry
7. Go back to your project environment, has the dependency been updated? Think: should you use `resolve` or `instantiate`?
